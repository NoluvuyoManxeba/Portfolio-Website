            I am a Full Stack Web developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. I specialize in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, and everything in between.
            As a developer, I have always been passionate about creating elegant and effective solutions to complex problems. I have a strong foundation in web development, with a focus on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end of applications, and I am always looking for ways to optimize performance, improve user experience, and ensure the highest level of code quality.
            Throughout my bootcamp with Hyperion Dev, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from simple static websites to applications. I am experienced in working with a variety of development tools and frameworks, including React, next.js, Node.js, and Express. I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I am constantly seeking out opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge.
